            <p>Just as Dieter Rams' principles defined good industrial design through his famous "Good design is..." statements, these principles aim to guide thoughtful design in the evolving Web3 landscape. While Rams focused on physical products, these principles adapt his philosophy to meet the unique challenges and opportunities of blockchain-based digital experiences.</p>
            
            <p>The "10 Principles of Good Design for Web3" is a framework for designers, developers, and product owners working in the blockchain and decentralized web space. These principles provide guidance for creating intuitive, accessible, and ethical interfaces for Web3 applications.</p>
            
            <p>This website was created as an open educational resource. The principles are meant to evolve alongside the technology, and we welcome contributions from the community.</p>
            
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>As Web3 technologies become more mainstream, the importance of thoughtful design increases. Many early Web3 applications prioritized technical functionality over user experience, creating barriers to adoption. These principles aim to bridge that gap by emphasizing human-centered design approaches within the unique context of decentralized applications.</p>
            
            <h3>Design Intent</h3>
            <p>This website exemplifies the principles it advocates for. The design is intentionally minimal and typography-focused, prioritizing readability and accessibility. The layout uses generous whitespace and a clear hierarchy to guide users through the content.</p>
            
            <p>The typeface pairing—serif for headings and sans-serif for body text—creates a balance between traditional design values and modern digital interfaces, reflecting how Web3 itself bridges established financial/social systems with new technological paradigms.</p>
